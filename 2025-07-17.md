Day 16 of learning flutter in tamil 
âœ… What I Learned:

AppBar Fundamentals
Learned the core structure and purpose of Flutter's AppBar widget â€” the main UI component at the top of the screen that sets the tone for the entire page.

Key Properties & Their Purpose

title: Displays the main label (Text or any widget)

backgroundColor: Customizes the background of the AppBar

leading: Adds a widget/icon on the left side

actions: Adds multiple widgets/icons on the right side

elevation: Controls the shadow depth

centerTitle: Aligns title to center (especially useful for iOS-style UIs)

automaticallyImplyLeading: Controls whether the default back arrow is shown

iconTheme: Customizes color/size of all AppBar icons

toolbarHeight: Increases vertical height of AppBar

flexibleSpace: Adds gradients, images, or background effects behind the AppBar


Practical Skills Gained

Added 5 custom icons to actions

Learned to increase space between icons using SizedBox(width: N)

Understood how to disable default back arrow and add a custom leading icon

Customized icon styles using iconTheme

Applied flexibleSpace for gradients and background effects

> "Today I took control of the AppBar â€” the header, the crown, the presence of my app. From icon placement to visual polish, I now have the skill to make my screens feel professional and intentional."
