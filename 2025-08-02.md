today I got back on my track ever since I talked about trading even though it's not good i accept what I am doing and I love it . you know what pown when learning flutter and talk about trading and back testing I feel the same energy like my whole body is waking up from  something.and I love that feeling well.

it may the second nature to me . and I love the way money works and manipulating .. they created a cbil report and score, so they get good offer and meanwhile if you don't know what you do then you will be used by others. man I am smiling at the system now how they are controling the people's life behind and i love it and hate it 

today I am trying to make decision wheather to entry in the trading feiled or not after the conversation end with the instructor form node js class. he is also planning to teach the course and he asked to help so ilthis may be my optutinty and the cause and effect trying to do something.
