🎥 Video Title: I Made No Progress in Flutter After 23 Days

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📌 What I Did Today:

✅ Reflected on 23 days of learning — acknowledged lack of visible progress  
✅ Committed to a new 30-day challenge to launch an open-source Flutter app  
✅ Declared “The Path of Kora” as the app name — tied to korelium theme  
✅ Finalized app concept as a self-cultivation themed dev log / UI practice app  
✅ Built working Flutter UI with:
   - Gradient AppBar
   - Stateful button interactions
   - Navigation using `Navigator.push` & `pop`
✅ Integrated a second screen: `LightHome()` with return navigation  
✅ Created fantasy-themed thumbnail for YouTube  
✅ Published raw devlog video to YouTube  
✅ Uploaded full `.mkv` journal video for archival  
✅ Started Git journaling plan for the whole 30-day roadmap  
✅ Asked ChatGPT to assist with:
   - Dart+Flutter combined learning roadmap
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Social media titles, descriptions, and tags
✅ Rebranded today’s log with style and emoji formatting  
✅ Set tone for Korelium as a fantasy-developer brand offering value through free learning tools

🗂️ Files/Assets Created Today:
- `main.dart`, `light_home.dart` updated  
- Cultivator-themed app scaffold built

🧘 Thought of the Day:
