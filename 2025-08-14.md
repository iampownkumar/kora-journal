FinVault Dev Journal – Full Project Log

📦 Project Kickoff & Setup
Initialized FinVault as a personal finance app using Flutter/Dart.

Set up folder structure: core, features, shared widgets, and routing.

Added minimal dependencies (provider, go_router, fl_chart, pdf, csv, shared_preferences).

🏗️ Phase 1 – App Foundation & Navigation
Built out main navigation shell and routing with GoRouter.

Implemented basic screens: Home, Accounts, Transactions, Categories, More.

Configured bottom navigation bar and basic app theming scaffold.

Tested core navigation flow between all main screens.

🗂 Phase 2 – CRUD Core Features
Implemented full CRUD for Accounts, Categories, and Transactions.

Created services and models for data storage and business logic.

Designed forms for adding/editing accounts, categories, transactions.

Ensured manual entry and editing flow worked smoothly.

🏦 Phase 3 Batch 1 – Advanced Models & Analytics Foundation
Added models/services for Credit Cards and Loans.

Enhanced database with new tables for credit cards, loans.

Implemented core financial calculations: utilization, loan status, monthly summaries.

Seeded initial dummy/sample data for development and tested analytics flows.

📈 Phase 3 Batch 2 – Beautiful Analytics UI
Built advanced analytics dashboard with Overview, Categories, and Trends tabs.

Integrated animated pie chart, line chart, and bar chart widgets.

Developed stat cards with growth indicators, top categories, and trend analysis.

Connected analytics to real transaction data for full interactivity.

💳 Phase 3 Batch 3a – Credit Card Management
Developed Credit Card dashboard with card-style UI and utilization indicators.

Enabled add/edit/delete of cards and credit usage warnings.

Designed modals/forms for easy credit card management.

💰 Phase 3 Batch 3b – Loan Management
Created dual-tabbed Loans dashboard (Loans Given and Loans Taken).

Implemented visual card design showing progress, payment, due/overdue status.

Enabled payment recording and “remaining” balance updates.

📤 Phase 3 Batch 3c – Export, Backup & Account Details
Implemented Export Service: export financial reports (PDF), transactions (CSV), and full backup (JSON).

Added share/export UI cards in More menu for user access.

Finalized Account Details page: shows all transactions per account, filtering and statistics included.

Removed all development/dummy data for clean production build with only essential categories.

🧹 App Polish & UX Enhancements (Phase 4)
Implemented splash screen and a beautiful “Welcome” onboarding page for first-launch users.

Set up SharedPreferences-based onboarding/returning-user logic.

Polished Add/Edit Transaction keyboard flow for “Next/Done” seamless entry.

Ensured all navigation and back button logic was clean and predictable.

Fixed theme provider: instant dark/light theme switching app-wide.

Improved “More” screen, About dialog, and settings navigation.

📱 Release Preparation & Build
Updated pubspec.yaml and About dialog: v1.3.0+3 for clean production.

Successfully committed final, production-ready codebase to GitHub.

Built clean APK with flutter build apk --release ready for distribution.

🔎 Final Testing
Verified splash, onboarding, and dark mode flows.

Confirmed no residual dummy/test data.

Tested all CRUD, analytics, credit card and loan flows from a new user perspective.

Verified all export/reporting functions.

Confirmed welcome screen appears only on first run, and user is routed directly to home on subsequent launches.

Reflections/Notes:
Started with only basic Flutter knowledge and iterated from zero to a full-featured, commercial-grade finance app in less than one working day (8 hours). All code was AI-guided, but every step, test, and architecture decision was understood and validated. End result: an app that rivals paid commercial products and is ready to share with friends and users.
