# 🗓️ Kora Journal — 03 July 2025 (Thursday)

## ✅ What I Did Today
- 🎥 Uploaded **second YouTube video** (raw dev journal)
- 📱 Posted **second Instagram reel**
- 🏀 Played basketball with 3 others — felt **mixed emotions**, but chose to play and enjoy it
- 📹 Edited video via mobile and exported successfully
- 🧠 Reflected deeply on my **inner resistance** to learning Flutter

---

## 🧠 Thoughts
"I felt some resentment during the basketball session — like *why are you playing with me if you don't care?*  
But I still allowed myself to play and flow with it. Maybe I needed that.

Also realized I’m still not clear about what exactly I want to learn in Flutter — too many resources and no structure.  
But at least I showed up today and uploaded again."

## ❌ What I Skipped
- ❌ Didn’t make solid progress on Flutter learning
- ❌ Didn’t study Python or automation

---

## ⚡️ Next Move
- Lock tomorrow’s plan: **Flutter UI basics (stateless/stateful, rows/columns)**
- Only watch 1–2 videos max → start building **one small app screen**
- Review how others learn: is it via docs, videos, or cloning apps?

## 🔥 Mood
Mixed but aware.  
Proud of staying consistent with video content even without motivation.
