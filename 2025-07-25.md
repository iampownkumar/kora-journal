Title: Bottom Navigation Realm Switcher UI
‚úÖ What I Did Today

    Practiced using BottomNavigationBar with 4 custom pages (Portal, Bestiary, Relics, Archives).

    Created a fantasy-themed Flutter UI called Realm Navigator.

    Used a List<Widget> to store realm pages and switched views based on index.

    Updated AppBar title dynamically using _titles[_selectedIndex].

    Fixed label display issues in BottomNavigationBar by setting type: BottomNavigationBarType.fixed.

    Applied TextTheme globally to change all text sizes in _realms.

    Explored how to structure app bar, body, and bottom nav statefully.

    Created short-form content ideas for Instagram/YouTube.

    Learned clean code structuring for navigation in Flutter.
