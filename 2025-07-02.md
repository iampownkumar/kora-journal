✅ What I Did Today:

📹 Uploaded my first raw public video

> “Day 0 — Broke, Jobless, but I’m Building Anyway”



🧠 Learned core Flutter concepts:

AppBar: The app's top navigation bar

StatelessWidget: Fixed layout, doesn’t change after build

StatefulWidget: Dynamic, can change via setState()


🛠️ Began mentally mapping small app ideas with these building blocks

🧘 State of Mind:

Feeling light but focused.
No filters, no bullshit.
Just me vs my limits — and I’ve started punching back.

🎯 What's Next (Tomorrow):

Learn TextField, ListView, setState

Start building a basic TODO or Expense Tracker UI

Log and edit Day 1 video (light cuts only, no polish)
